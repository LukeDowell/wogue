# Wogue

This is going to be a networked playground for me to test out implementations of things that interest
me. Map generation, general RPG elements, effective game networking and graphics implementations are just some of the 
things I'll be playing around with in Wogue (Although honestly I'll probably try and shove LibGDX in once I get some
content to actually render.)
